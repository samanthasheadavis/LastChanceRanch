	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 17px;">Dear Supporter, </span></p>
	<p>
		 </p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 17px;">All of us at Last Chance Ranch would like to thank you for your good wishes, support of our mission and generosity during 2016. So many injured, sick and homeless animals were able to be saved with the help of your donations. As of September we have placed 711 animals including 492 dogs, 63 cats, 38 horses, and 118 various small companion, reptile and farm animals. I would like to take this opportunity to share just a few major activities and accomplishments of 2016. To stay up-to-date with the happenings of Last Chance Ranch</span><span style="font-size: 17px;">, please sign up on our website for our E-News.   </span><br />
		 </p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 17px;">Nearly four weeks into the new year, we received a plea to assist with a large scale humane seizure in Carbon County, PA. Sixteen horses, twenty-one sheep and goats, several dogs, a pig and cow were rescued from the neglect of a veterinarian. We brought nine of the sixteen horses, all the sheep and goats and three dogs to our facility for intensive rehabilitation. Of the animals rescued, Clarissa captured the hearts of many as her rags to riches story was broadcasted through many media outlets.</span></p>
	<p>
		 </p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 17px;">Clarissa was extremely emaciated and una</span><span style="font-size: 17px;">ble to stand </span><span style="font-size: 17px;">during the trailer ride to our facility. Our staff and volunteers were able to carry her off the trailer, but it took the help of the Richlandtown Fire Company and neig</span><span style="font-size: 17px;">hboring rescue departments to lift her back to her feet. The first 48 hours were difficult, but Clarissa proved to be a fighter. We were able to support Clarissa for over a month with an Anderson Sling until she could stand on her own.</span></p>
	<p>
		 </p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 17px;">After a few short months, Clarissa gained over 300 pounds and blossomed into a wonderful young mare. Our volunteer trainers started working with her under saddle to prepare her for a new life. In July, a young woman named Taylor came out to meet Clarissa. Taylor and Clarissa instantly formed a lifelong partnership. Clarissa left for her new home at the end of July.      </span></p>
	<p>
		 </p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 17px;">Every day at Last Chance Ranch is an adventure as our staff and volunteers are well aware of! One night at 10:30, we were alerted that several of our sheep escaped our pasture. Upon inspection, we found that all of our sheep were accounted for and that some stray sheep found their way to the ranch. Affectionately named, Sealy and Serta were in desperate need of shearing. After a fresh shave, they felt right at home with their new friends.</span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 17px;"> </span></p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 17px;">One of our most recent rescues is sweet Annabelle, a senior Pitbull who was found as a stray in Philadelphia. Underweight, suffering from hair loss, worn teeth and unable to bear weight on her hind end, Annabelle was destined to be euthanized. We quickly stepped in to be Annabelle's <em>Last Chance</em>. After a veterinary exam, we found that Annabelle suffered from an unattended broken leg that painfully healed on its own. Since the leg did not heal straight, this led to further damage to her ACL due to her body compensating. Annabelle is being kept comfortable with pain meds and cage rest while her x-rays are being evaluated to determine the best plan for her recovery. Please check our E-news for updates on Annabelle!</span></p>
	<p>
		 </p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 17px;">Continuing our mission, "Rescue, Adopt, Educate," we are excited to announce the grand opening of the first floor of our Agriculture and Education Center. This space includes a conference room which can seat up to 8 people for small meetings and a large classroom that accommodates up to 100 people for seminars and presentations. These spaces allow us to continue education programs for children, new pet owners, the community and our volunteers. Additionally, these spaces will be available for rental t</span><span style="font-size: 17px;">o businesses and community groups for offsite meetings.  Please contact our office for more information.</span></p>
	<p>
		 </p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 17px;">At Last Chance Ranch, we pride ourselves on not having to turn away an injured or unwanted animal in desperate need of food, shelter and a safe home, it all comes at a great cost.  We have spent over $162,000.00 on feed/medical/veterinary fees in the last year, along with the everyday costs needed to keep us up and running.  Your support is <u>necessary</u> to continue serving the animals that need our help. We are grateful to have compassionate and generous supporters like you.  We now need to appeal to your generosity for a year-end <strong>tax deductible</strong> donation to help us save so many more lives in 2017.</span></p>
	<p>
		 </p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 17px;">With heartfelt appreciation for your support throughout the year, Last Chance Ranch would like to extend our wishes to you and your family for a wonderful Holiday Season.  </span></p>
	<p>

	<img alt="" src="/lcr/content/images/Clarissa(1)_400x225.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 225px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;" /></p>
<p>
	If you are an animal lover you've probably gone to a veterinarian at one point or another. You think of your vet as your pet's best friend and a savior if anything were to go wrong. But…what do you do when the <u>vet</u> is the one you can't trust and has broken your confidence in animal medical care?</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	In my line of work as an animal rescuer and Humane Police Officer I have met many vets. I have been in countless shelters, disaster zones, vet's offices, colleges, etc., and have met some truly amazing veterinarians. It's not an easy profession.  But never…. ever….in my life have I imagined meeting a vet that didn't care…. until now.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	I have not personally met Dr. Clyde "Renny" Shoop nor his ex-wife Kim, but it is just unfathomable to me what they have done. The Shoops had dozens of horses and various other animals entrusted into their care only to allow them to be neglected, abused and forgotten.  As this story of extreme cruelty began to unfold – each detail more horrific than the next -  it became one of the worst cases of animal abuse to hit our area in years…and at the hands of a trusted veterinarian no less.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	A tip called in to police reported a dead horse as well as several emaciated horses roaming the property.  On Jan. 22, 2016 police searched the property and found nine of 16 horses in critical condition, as well as 18 sheep, 2 goats and 3 dogs. Five of the most critically injured horses — one adult male, one adult female, one juvenile female and two juvenile males — were taken from the property. Those five were taken to a veterinarian in the Quakertown area. Only three of the five would survive, with two having to be euthanized. They also found at least five dead horses — two hidden beneath wooden pallets, one beneath a burned mattress, and two in a pit with the remains of other burned animals. Last Chance Ranch had two of those critically ill horses.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	One of those horses, Clarissa - an emaciated 7-year-old TB cross - gave us many challenges and literally hung in the balance of life and death. Over three hundred pounds underweight, Clarissa was extremely emaciated and unable to stand during the trailer ride to our facility.        </p>

<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	Our staff and volunteers were able to carry her off the trailer, but it took the help of the Richlandtown Fire Company and neighboring rescue departments to lift her back to her feet. The first 48 hours were difficult, but Clarissa proved to be a fighter. With the help of a rented Anderson sling, we were able to support Clarissa for over a month until she could support herself.  </p>
<p align="center">
	 </p>
<p>
	For five long months of rehabilitation, with worried volunteers rallying to keep her spirits up, Clarissa started to flourish, gained over 300 pounds</p>
<p>
	and has blossomed into a wonderful young filly. Our volunteer trainers started working with her under saddle to prepare her for a new life.</p>
<p align="center">
	          </p>
<p>
	This summer, a young woman named Taylor came out to meet Clarissa. Taylor and Clarissa<img alt="" src="/lcr/content/images/IMG_0238_180x240.JPG" style="width: 180px; height: 240px; margin: 5px; float: right;" /> instantly formed a lifelong partnership and this once abused and neglected horse left for her new home at the end of July. We recently received a wonderful update from Taylor in August:</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	<em>"Clarissa is very happy and healthy and loves her new life! She stands in the wash stall as well as on cross ties with no issues. She has had about </em><em>3 baths and is starting to enjoy them. She has come a long way in such a short amount of time and I am beyond excited for</em><em> what the future holds for her!"</em>  </p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	We are so happy for Taylor and Clarissa and look forward to more updates as Clarissa's training progresses. Thank you everyone for your support!</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	We've also had some critical times with Otto, our 25 +/- buckskin, who was almost forgotten about.<img alt="" src="/lcr/content/images/IMG_0247.JPG" style="width: 180px; height: 240px; margin: 5px; float: right;" /> He was hidden behind the Shoops' house and was so skinny you could see his hips from a mile away. His gentle whinny and big brown eyes have wooed me into submission to give him anything he wants. His perkiness, will to want to walk and get better gives me strength to go on. Tireless nights for me are nothing compared to what these poor animals have endured. They are all on the path to recovery.   </p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	As I look into these soulful eyes and they look back at me, I can't help but wonder what they're thinking: that they have unlimited food or are they still scared they won't get another meal? After years of torment and neglect how can they possibly let us, humans, help them. I have spent many nights out in the barn with our new friends. When it's quiet and the volunteers have all gone home for the night it's my turn to watch over our precious friends and keep them safe. I listen to them eating and sometimes can't sleep thinking they may need something or may get into a bad position and can't get up because they are too weak from starvation.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	I have been asked multiple times, "What if LCR was not here?" Where would they have gone?". Unfortunately, there is such a great need for a place like Last Chance Ranch to step in to rescue, rehabilitate and rehome the many animals that have been (and continue to be) neglected and abused.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	There are some bad people out there, but I have found, thankfully, the number of good individuals far outweigh the negative. LCR is here for all animals and with your help Clarissa, Otto and all their friends will be healthy and happy and ready for a new family. It has been a tireless effort by many with rewarding results. These brown eyed babies would love to meet you so they can thank you with a whinny, a horse hug and bark for saving them. My promise to our animals is we are here for <u>them</u>. I want them to know they will always be fed, loved, cared for and never scared again.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	But without the public's help we cannot continue to help so many in need. Donations are needed in so many ways. All donations directly help these and future animals in need. We can't thank everyone enough for the outpouring of assistance at this critical time.</p>

	<strong>February 9th Update:</strong></p>
<p>
	All in all, LCR is caring for 9 horses including Otto and Clarissa the most critical of the 9 pictured below, as well as two pregnant mares. Additionally, we have 3 dogs and 19 sheep and 2 goats. Many of the goats and sheep are pregnant. We are so thankful for the generous support of the community who has pulled together and shown their support during this atrocious case of animal cruetly. Charges were filed against Dr. Renny Shoop VMD and Kimberly Shoop on Wednesday, February 3rd.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	It will be a long road to recovery and we are hopeful that both Otto and Clarissa will pull through!</p>

<p>
	On Friday, January 22<sup>nd</sup> Last Chance Ranch (LCR) received a phone call to aid in the rescue of over 16 horses. With the impending snow storm, it was imperative to get the most critical horses to the vet. LCR aided in the transport of 5 critical horses to Quakertown Vet Clinic on Friday, which are going to <a href="http://www.defhr.org/" target="_blank">Days End Farm Horse Rescue</a> due to the investigation. On Tuesday, January 26<sup>th</sup>, after the storm subsided, our rescue efforts continued. We were back on the site and transported an additional 7 horses, 20 sheep and 1 dog to our facility for emergency care.  Of the horses, three are severely emaciated with a Henneke Body Score of 0, needing round the clock care.  Two are pregnant and the other two have a Henneke Body Score between 1 and 2. Four additional horses remain on the scene and cannot be transported until the snow is cleared up more. These horses all have a Henneke Body Score between 2-3 and are being fed by those who assisted with the rescue efforts until it is safe enough to transport them.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	The three emaciated horses that arrived at our facility on Tuesday were not able to stand during the trailer ride. These horses had to be pulled off the trailer and carried into our barn. The worst went to Quakertown Vet Clinic for emergency vet care. The efforts of the team of staff, volunteers and newly made friends for these horses were amazing. Everyone pulled together to literally carry these stoic horses not giving up their will to live.</p>

	Details of the situation are not able to be disclosed, as this is an ongoing investigation by the Pennsylvania State Police. This is by far the worst case of neglect LCR has seen. The volume of animals and the number of dead horses on the property was astounding. Last Chance Ranch is doing everything we can to ensure the animals in our care are receiving the veterinary and nutritional care they need to get them back up to speed. We need everyone's support, prayers and donations if you can to help these animals pull through.</p>

At this time we cannot release the location these animals were seized from.</span></span></p>

	We wish to thank everyone who has donated, adopted and volunteered to help Last Chance Ranch grow to what it is today. With the growing need for our life-saving services, education seminars and clinics, LCR has used up every inch of space to help rescue, rehabilitate and re-home abused and neglected animals(including horses, dogs, cats, farm animals and small companion animals). Early 2015, we received the final go-ahead to begin our 5-Phase Agriculture and Education Center Expansion Project! This is a million dollar project that will allow everyone of all ages and abilities to interact and become an integral part of LCR's animal rescue family.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	The expansion includes, but is not limited to, Meet and Greet rooms for potential adopters to get to know their new 'family member' in a comfortable atmosphere, our own Surgical Suite for in-house veterinary care, small animal areas strategically built into the walls, a large covered building for evaluating. training and teaching volunteers about the animals we care for, along with 3 large seminar rooms for all-weather training of dogs, horses, seminars and clinics.</p>

<p>
	April of 2015 Last Chance Ranch received approval for a matching grant of $10,000 from the ASPCA to aid with our current expansion process! The grant for "Equine Facility Expansion" aligned perfectly with our 5-Phase Expansion that began in early 2015. These funds went directly to the construction of our Agricultural building, which will be able to house 12 additional horses and allow for all weather training and exercise. Thank you so much to the ASPCA!</p>

	<span style="font-size:18px;"><a name="Wings"><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);"><strong>Please Help LCR Give "Angel" Back Her Wings!</strong></span></a></span><br />
	<img alt="" src="/lcr/content/images/angel%202_200x239.JPG" style="width: 200px; height: 239px; float: right; margin: 4px;" /><br />
	As many of you know, Last Chance Ranch saves most of its dogs from high-kill shelters. Our goal is to Rescue, Rehabilitate and Re-home. However, in some cases, we also bring in the occasional sick animal that has no hope left due to age or severe illness and offer them a few hours or days of affection, nurturing, comfort and the feeling that they ARE loved and cared for.<br />
	<br />
	LCR Founder Lori McCutcheon saw an alert from Animal Care and Control about a sweet little Maltese with a very bleak and extremely short future.<br />
	<br />
	This little angel was tossed out of a moving car, landing on the side of the road. As the car sped off, a passerby ran over to retrieve her before she could roll into oncoming traffic. This Good Samaritan took her to ACCT for care. After a preliminary exam it was determined that this sweet dog was paralyzed in her hind legs - probably the reason for her heartless and cruel disposal.<br />
	<br />
	The thought of her being euthanized without anyone being with her was more than Lori could imagine. She immediately decided to bring the Maltese back to LCR, give her the love she desperately needed and help her cross the Rainbow Bridge surrounded by people who cared.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" src="/lcr/content/images/Angel%201.jpg" style="float: left; width: 230px; height: 129px; margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px;" /> Then something interesting happened...everyone fell in love with her.<br />
	<br />
	Her sweet demeanor, happy disposition (despite her predicament) and fighting spirit gave LCR volunteers and staff the determination to help this "Angel" get back on her feet and, hopefully, into a loving forever home!<br />
	<br />
	Lori noticed there appeared to be some movement in Angel's back legs and, with nothing to lose and everything to gain, we began to work with her.<br />
	<br />
	Although Angel is literally taking 'baby steps' toward her recovery, she still has a long and very expensive path of rehabilitation ahead of her.<br />
	<a href="https://vimeo.com/137851118" target="_blank">(Please see video)</a><br />
	<br />

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">In late December of 2014, LCR was called in by ACCT in Philadelphia to help with a severely injured pot-bellied pig. It's likely that someone unsuccessfully tried to use her for Christmas dinner by attempting to decapitate her. We brought her into LCR and began treating her substantial injuries. Despite the tremendous pain she was in, Cheesedoodle, was a sweet and trusting (still!), house-trained sweetheart who quickly became a kennel favorite with our volunteers and media: <strong><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><em><a href="http://www.wfmz.com/news/news-regional-southeasternpa/abused-pet-pig-left-for-dead-gets-new-lease-on-life-in-quakertown/30654156" target="_blank"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Abused pet pig, left for dead, gets new lease on life in Quakertown</span></a> (WFMZ 69)</em></span></strong></span></p>

<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Then on January 24th, 2015, Cheesedoodle gave staff and volunteers a huge thank you (</span></span><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">a</span></span><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">nd surprise!) by delivering 4adorable piglets!

<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	Last Chance Ranch began as a non-profit horse rescue in 1999. Since that time we have grown and changed in many ways to help animals in need. We have found the best way to help more animals is to partner with other organizations to achieve a common goal. Last Chance Ranch wishes to develop a new program in an effort to save more horses from uncertain fates, as well as provide a service to the community.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<p>
	Last Chance Ranch is proud to partner with Local Mounted Patrol Units including Baltimore and Philadelphia to help save more horses and provide a service to the public. We currently have two horses serving Baltimore and four horses serving Philly. We hope to continue providing horses to mounted patrol units across the United States. For more information regarding this program, please contact <a href="mailto:lori@lastchanceranch.org?subject=Mounted%20Patrol%20Program">Lori</a>.</p>
